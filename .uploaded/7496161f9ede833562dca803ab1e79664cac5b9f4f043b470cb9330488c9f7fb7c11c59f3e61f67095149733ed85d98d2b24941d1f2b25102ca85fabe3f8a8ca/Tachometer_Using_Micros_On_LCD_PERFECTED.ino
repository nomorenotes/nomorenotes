//Perfected on May 12, 2023

// After perfecting with a Hall Effect sensor, I tried using the IR sensor module I got from Amazon
//and it did just as well, very accurately displaying the RPMs on the LCD screen. I did notice that
//holding the IR Sensor made it easy for my hand to drift off of the piece of white tape I put on
//the treadmill motor, with subsequent false readings, but mounted permanently in a fixed position
//I believe it would work flawlessly.  So bottom line, Hall Effect AND IR Sensor work great in this
//sketch. Did not have to change any coding...just unplugged the Hall Effect sensor and plugged in
// (according to POS, GND, and OUT) with no problems at all.

//Name of YouTube is...Arduino Tutorial: Tachometer (RPM Counter)
//Author of this video is InterlinkKnight
//This uses the Hall Effect Sensor A3144:
//This sketch, unlike all the other Tachometers on YouTube, is VERY accurate and
//his sketch is on the Serial monitor, but I put it also on a LCD, so BOTH serial
//monitor AND LCD work great, down to 100 RPM. I also made another change and that is
//if the "average" drops below 100 (which drops the readout down to "0"), the
//LCD "clears" itself of random numbers which sometimes stayed on the LCD. Perfect now.
//This would be perfect to put a small magnet on the treadmill motor, and since the 
//pulley on the treadmill is 2", and the Grain mills pulley is 12", setting a speed of
//360 on the treadmill will give me a Grain Mill speed of exactly 60.
//I may have to work around the "100 RPM" cutout, and divide the 360 on the treadmill
//motor by 6 to give me a readout on the LCD of 60. So it would be 
//"lcd.print(average/6)" to give me a LCD reading of 60 on the Grain Mill.
//So, I will have to revise the 100 RPM cutoff for that purpose.




/*
Tachometer using micros

On this sketch we are going to measure the period between pulses using the micros() function to get the RPM
(Revolutions Per Minute) from a sensor on pin 2.
This way of measuring RPM makes it accurate, responsive and versatile. No matter how fast or slow the loop is
running, the reading accuracy is not going to be affected. Although, the faster you run the loop, the more amount
of readings you are going to be able to display every second.

It's coded in a way that the micros rollover doesn't create glitches every 71 minutes, so it can run forever
without problems.

We use an interrupt for the input so you have to choose pin 2 or 3 (for Arduino Uno/nano). In this example we
use pin 2.

This sketch was made for my video tutorial shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2uJMJWsfsg

// If the period between pulses is too high, or even if the pulses stopped, then we would get stuck 
//showing the last value instead of a 0. Because of this we are going to set a limit for the 
//maximum period allowed.
// If the period is above this value, the RPM will show as 0.
// The higher the set value, the longer lag/delay will have to sense that pulses stopped, 
//but it will allow readings at very low RPM.
// Setting a low value is going to allow the detection of stop situations faster, but it will 
//prevent having low RPM readings.
// The unit is in microseconds.
